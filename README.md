# Brain_tumour
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify brain MRI scans into "tumor" or "no tumor" using TensorFlow/Keras. The model leverages multiple convolutional layers, ReLU activations, batch normalization, dropout, and softmax classification.
A Gradio-based web app is included for real-time image prediction.

Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, OpenCV, Gradio
Features:

Custom CNN with dropout & batch norm to prevent overfitting

Real-time predictions via interactive Gradio UI

Tested on unseen MRI scans with strong generalization

Deployed and ready for practical healthcare use
